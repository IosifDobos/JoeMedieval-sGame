# JoeMedieval-sGame

## Object Oriented Programming Assignment II	
This game was created for OOP module year two. I have created this game based on one of my favourite game Age of Empire, JOE MEDIEVAL GAME is a different version. 
The game works by completing different missions that each character from the game holds it. The characters on the game haolds different missions, 
in order to move to a next mission you must finish the active one. 
Also int game I have built a shop where you can buy weapons shields to protect against enemies and so on still in progress. 
I have create an inventory panel for the player where it can store all the rewards form the game, also he can change the weapons, still in progress.
This project is still ongoing and I want to bring this game to a high standard.

## Technology used for my game:
	I have used GitHub to store my game and as a backup. I have used Unity Engine to create the game. 
All assets that are used in my game are downloaded and imported from 
Unity Assets store free of charge. C# OOP language was used for this game. As I am new with this language, I had to do some research online and I bought few unity courses on udemy 
to get some experience before starting the game. 
This is an individual project made by Iosif Dobos. Before creating the game some research was made and I have created a plan on order to build the game. 
This is a start of my project and I want to expand this game in the future to build a good game.
