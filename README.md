# JoeMedieval-sGame

## Object Oriented Programming Assignment II
	
This game was created for OOP module year two. I create this game based on one of my favourite game Edge of Empire. JOE MEDIEVAL GAME works by completing different missions
that I made it up myself. Different characters on the game have different mission in order to move to a next mission you must finish the active one. Also the game has a shop 
where you can buy weapons shields to protect against enemies and so on. I create an inventory for the player where it can change the weapon preference, can sell extra items etc.
This project is still ongoing and I want to bring this game to a high standard.

##Thechnology used for my game:
	I have used GitHub to store my game and as a backup. I used Unity Engine to create the game. All assets that are used in my game are dawnloaded and imported from Unity Assets store free of charge. 
C# OOP language was used for this game. As I am new with this language, I had to do some research and course to gain some experience before starting the game.
This is an individual project made by Iosif Dobos. Before create the game some reasearch was made and I create a plan on order to build the game. This is a start of my project and I want to expand this game in the future
to build a good game.
